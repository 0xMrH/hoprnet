# Issue tracking

Principles:

- Track our bugs / enhancements / milestones in one repository.
- Have the ability to filter them by:
  - origin: core / chat / core & chat (we can prefix these labels with "pkg:core")
  - type: bug / enhancement
  - milestone: if applicable, else it's considered in backlog
  - assigne: if applicable, else it's considered unassigned

## Creating an issue

- A team-member, or an external contributor creates an issue using [bug report](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) or [feature request](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.md) templates.
- A team-member labels the issue accordingly.
- (Optional) A team-member adds a milestone.
- (Optional) A team-member assignes a user.
