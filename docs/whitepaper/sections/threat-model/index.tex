\section{Threat Model}
Although we assume that nodes in the HOPR network can communicate reliably, the network can still be damaged by malicious attacks and node failures. We assume byzantine nodes with either the ability to observe all network traffic and launch network attacks or inject, drop or delay messages. 
\\~\\There are different attack vectors which could threaten the security of HOPR network, in the following section we mention these attacks and the mitigation methods used by HOPR to resist them:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sybil attacks: 
   \item Eclipse attacks:
   \item Camouflage attacks:
   \item Payment protocol leaks
   
   
\end{itemize}
