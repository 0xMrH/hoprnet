\subsection{Incentivized Behavior}
\label{sec:incentives:behavior}

Transforming a mixnet packet in order to send it to the next downstream node $n_{i+1}$ requires computation done by relayer $n_i$. It also requires effort by the relayer to establish a connection to $n_{i+1}$ and cache packets for a short period of time. Both of these mechanisms are crucial to provide a stable and usable network, hence they are incentivized by the protocol.
