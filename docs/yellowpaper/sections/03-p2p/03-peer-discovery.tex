\subsection{Peer Discovery}

Newly connected nodes are lacking information about existing nodes in the network and thus need the help of others who help them discover the rest of the network. Within the HOPR network, this is done using so-called entry nodes who behave like normal nodes but publish their connection information on-chain. Nodes who join the network have therefore the opportunity to fetch Ethereum blocks and scan them for node announcments.

The HOPR network decides two types of announcements: with a routable address and without

Apart from the altruistic benefit to the network, It is expected that announcing on-chain does not immediately lead to direct payout. But since \lcnameref{sec:path-selection} is based on availability, nodes that announce themselves and also have a good availability are chosen more likely as a relayer which increases their rewards.

Announcing on a public blockchain comes with the property that a potentail adversary who attempts to run an eclipse attack against a newly connected node also needs to provide a sound and fake blockchain which is assumed to be hard. Hence, the attacker is unable to withhold entry nodes but nevertheless, it is able to spam the victim with connection information about collaborating nodes.

In addition to blockchain announcements, nodes participate in a DHT and thereby get in touch with those nodes that have not announced themselves on-chain with a routable address.
