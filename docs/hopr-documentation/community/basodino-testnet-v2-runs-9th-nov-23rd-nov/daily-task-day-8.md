# Daily Task Day 8

My first is in MATIC but not in xDAI  
  
My second’s in PRIVACY, but isn’t in SPY  
  
My third’s found within the mysterious SPHINX   
  
My fourth is a letter not found at [**these**](../hopr-games/) [**l**](../hopr-games/#goals)**inks**.  
  
My fifth and my sixth are both in METADATA  
  
My whole is how HOPR makes life online safer.
