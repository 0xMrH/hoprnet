# Getting started

This page will guide you installing and running a HOPR node in your computer on a local testnet.

## Local environment

The following instructions are meant for you to run a local HOPR node. As a result, you will not be able to connect to other peers other than yourself. To learn how to run a "live" HOPR node, please go to [Install a HOPR node](../install-hoprd/index.md).
