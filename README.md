# HOPR

HOPR \(pronounced ˈhɑpər\) is a **privacy-preserving messaging protocol** and a **decentralised network** with **economic incentives on a blockchain**.

HOPR provides privacy by relaying messages via several relay nodes to the recipient, which “hop” through different nodes connected in the network. These messages use the [Sphinx package format](https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf) to avoid leaking any data about their contents.

The HOPR network relies on multiple individuals running instances of the [HOPR Core Service \(HP-CS\)](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-core) over a public-available infrastructure. The HP-CS runs in multiple devices and operating systems over the internet.

Nodes participating in the HOPR network get paid for their services via blockchain payment channels. Every time a message hops through a different node, its maintainer is rewarded in the blockchain’s native digital currency.
