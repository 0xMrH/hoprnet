# HOPR

HOPR \(pronounced 'hopper'\) is a **privacy-preserving messaging protocol** **\(HOPR Protocol\)** and a **decentralized network \(HOPR Network\)** with **economic incentives \(HOPR Token\) on a blockchain**.

HOPR provides privacy by relaying messages through multiple “hops” via different relay nodes connected to the HOPR Network. These messages use the [Sphinx packet format](https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf) to avoid leaking any data about their contents, the sender or the recipient.

The HOPR Network relies on multiple individuals running HOPR Nodes over a public-available infrastructure. HOPR Nodes can run in multiple devices and operating systems over the internet.

Nodes participating in the HOPR Network get paid for their services via blockchain payment channels in the form of HOPR Tokens. Every time a message hops through a different node, its maintainer is rewarded with a probability of earning HOPR Tokens, which can be used within the network as means of payment for requesting services from other HOPR Nodes.
