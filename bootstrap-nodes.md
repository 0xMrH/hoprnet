# Bootstrap Nodes

In order to properly work, **HOPR Chat** relies in the concept of **Bootstrap Nodes**. These are nodes created with a `bootstrap` setting enabled, as to function only as relayers for other nodes in the ecosystem. Without **Bootstrap Nodes**, **HOPR Chat** will currently not work.

**Bootstrap Nodes** are only mean to be an initial relayer of connection between nodes. This means that as soon as a communication between two or more **HOPR Chat** nodes has been stablished, a **Bootstrap Node** is node longer need to keep communicating to it.

As an analogy, you can think of **Bootstrap Nodes** as the guests that know everyone in a party. They can introduce you to other people, and then you can talk directly to them.

To run **HOPR Chat** as a bootstrap node, you can just pass a `-b` flag to the running command.

## Available Bootstrap Nodes

Feel free to use any \(or all\) of the following URLs as your `BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` parameter in your **HOPR Chat** Docker image. Each of our **Bootstrap Nodes** are located in different countries and serve a specific environment.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Beta

Our **Testnet Bootstrap Nodes** are fixed and deployed via our [GitHub DevOps repository](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devops). These are currently being considered _beta_ technology and might be replaced at different times. However, we will notify our users when doing so via our [Telegram Channel](http://t.me/hoprnet).

These nodes are behind HOPR Services AG DNS registry. In case you want to directly access them without the DNS request, you can simply pass these directly.

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha

Our **Develop Bootstrap Nodes** are constantly changing and deployed via our [GitHub DevOps repository](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devops). These are currently being considered _alpha_ technology and are replaced multiple times over the week. To use or test them, please check our [Builds Page](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devops/actions?query=workflow%3ATerraform).
