# Funding Your Node

The SÃ¤ntis testnet is being hosted on xDAI Chain, a sidechain of Ethereum. In order to participate in the testnet, you'll need to fund your node with a small amount of xDAI.  
  
First, you'll need to load some ETH into your Ethereum wallet. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is one of the most widely supported wallets, but there are other options.

Next, you'll need to convert some ETH into xDAI. There are several tools you can use to do this. The simplest is to connect your wallet to the tool at [xdai.io](https://xdai.io), where you can swap ETH to DAI and then DAI to xDAI.

Finally, you'll need to send some xDAI to your node. Because xDAI is a separate chain, you'll need to change the network settings in MetaMask. [The xDAI docs have a step-by-step guide for this](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup).  
  
Once you've sent xDAI to your node, restart HOPR Chat and the client will automatically detect your balance and allow you to proceed.  
  
Later, you can check your balance by typing `balance`\(because the HOPR mainnet will run on the Ethereum mainchain, you'll currently see your balance described as ETH rather than xDAI\).
