# Quickstart

To get started with HOPR, we'll use **HOPR Chat**, a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) Proof-of-Concept command line utility the HOPR team has put together to showcase HOPRâ€™s capabilities as a privacy-preserving communication protocol. **HOPR Chat** allows you to communicate anonymously with other users running **HOPR Chat** in their machines.

To use **HOPR Chat**, your system requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), a containerisation engine able to virtualise any application. To learn how to install Docker Desktop and **HOPR Chat** in your operating system, please use the following links.
