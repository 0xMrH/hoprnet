### Instructions

#### Background

The \#HOPRGames party celebrating the launch of the HOPR Node PC in partnership with [Avado](https://ava.do/checkout/hopr) is the hottest event in town. There’s 2x150 xDAI in giveaways to share between the first 15 people who turn up on each day. Unfortunately, BouncerBot is under strict instructions to only let people on the guest list in. But I’m sure you’ll be able to find a way.

#### Steps

Download and install the latest version of HOPR Chat. If this is your first time installing, you might want to look at our quick-start guide.

{% hint style="info" %}
Important! Only HOPR Chat versions v1.4.0 and later will work with this bounty. We recommend downloading the following version - [https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-chat/relea**ses/tag/v1.4.2**](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-chat/releases/tag/v1.4.2)**.**
{% endhint %}

Next, fire up **HOPR Chat**! You should be able to see a prompt to showcase everything is ready for you to type, right after the text “Connecting to bootstrap nodes” show up.

**Time to identify yourself**

Before entering the party, you need to identify yourself. To do so, run the command `includeRecipient` which will embed your address to all messages you send.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you run `includeRecipient` before going forward! Without doing so, BouncerBot will not be able to reach you back.
{% endhint %}

You can always see whether you are including your settings in **HOPR Chat** by typing `settings`.

**Name the bot**

On version `1.4.x` we have introduced a new command, called `alias`. `alias` helps you "save" the address of a user to use it later. Since you probably want to save the address of BouncerBot, you can run the following to save it for later:

```text
alias 16Uiu2HAmQwrnGFaBKna38pMkk9tkACMnqhcoGRh1q2rNLBo516Eh bouncerbot
```

Now, `bouncerbot` is available for all your send messages.

**Try to get into the party**

Time to get into the party! Message `bouncerbot` to try and enter to the party. You might need to give multiple tries before going forward. Good luck!
